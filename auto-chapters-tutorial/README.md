## Automatic Chapter Detection With AssemblyAI

In this tutorial you will learn how to do automatic chapter detection using the AssemblyAI API. The Auto Chapters feature provides a "summary over time" for audio content transcribed with AssemblyAI's Speech-to-Text API. It works by first breaking audio/video files into logical "chapters" as the topic of conversation changes, and then provides an automatically generated summary for each "chapter" of content.
